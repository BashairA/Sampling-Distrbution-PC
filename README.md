# Sampling Distributions Introduction- practice by Udacity- Data Analyst Nanodegree Program
This is a practice by Udacity to gain a bit more comfort with this idea of sampling distributions in python.

The sample represents the students, where 1 represents the students that drink coffee, and 0 represents the students that do not drink coffee.

# Note
The most of the codes are provided by Udacity and I practice it again on the dataset.
